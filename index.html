<h1>La-Mulana Remake item graph</h1>
<div style="width:600px;">This graph shows you how all items are related to each other, based on the Randomizer's requirements<br/>
You can zoom by holding shift and scrolling the mouse wheel<br/>
You can click on various nodes, which makes it show all the nodes required to get to the selected one<br/><br/>
This does have a few issues though due to there being cyclic requirements. Also, not every edge connecting to a node might be required, the game often has multiple ways to get a single item, and I've not found a way yet to properly group specific edges.<br/><br/>
